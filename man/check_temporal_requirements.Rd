\title{Check temporal requirements for causal inference}
\usage{
check_temporal_requirements(
  baseline_time,
  treatment_times,
  outcome_times,
  requirements = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{baseline_time}{Time of baseline measurements}

\item{treatment_times}{Vector of treatment times}

\item{outcome_times}{Vector of outcome measurement times}

\item{requirements}{List of specific requirements to check}
}
\value{
List with logical 'valid' and character vector 'messages'
describing any violations
}
\description{
Verifies that data meets temporal requirements for causal inference,
such as having baseline measurements before treatment and outcomes
measured after treatment.
}
\examples{
# check basic temporal ordering
check_temporal_requirements(
  baseline_time = 0,
  treatment_times = c(1, 2),
  outcome_times = c(3, 4)
)

# check with specific requirements
check_temporal_requirements(
  baseline_time = 0,
  treatment_times = 1,
  outcome_times = c(2, 3),
  requirements = list(min_followup = 1)
)
}
