\title{Generate Seed Sequence}
\usage{
generate_seed_sequence(n, base_seed = NULL, method = c("spaced", "digest"))
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of seeds to generate}

\item{base_seed}{Starting seed (NULL for random)}

\item{method}{Method for generating seeds ("spaced" or "digest")}
}
\value{
Integer vector of seeds
}
\description{
Creates a sequence of well-separated seeds for independent runs.
This is useful for Monte Carlo simulations where each replication
needs an independent seed.
}
\examples{
# Generate 10 seeds for independent simulations
seeds <- generate_seed_sequence(10, base_seed = 123)

# Use in parallel computations
results <- lapply(seeds, function(s) {
  with_seed(s, {
    # simulation code here
  })
})
}
