\description{
This class represents temporal measurement errors where the timing of
measurement differs from the timing of the actual exposure or outcome.
Common in longitudinal studies where exposures occur continuously but
are measured at discrete visits.
}
\details{
Temporal measurement errors can arise from:
\itemize{
\item Retrospective reporting (e.g., "in the past month...")
\item Prospective reporting (e.g., "do you plan to...")
\item Measurement delays (exposure at t, measured at t+1)
\item Aggregation over intervals (continuous exposure, periodic measurement)
\item Recall bias affecting timing accuracy
}
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Retrospective measurement with 30-day recall window
tme_retro <- new_temporal_measurement_error(
  error_type = "retrospective",
  affected_variables = c("t1_a", "t2_a", "t3_a"),
  window_size = 30,  # days
  window_type = "fixed",
  aggregation = "any",  # any exposure in window â†’ 1
  reference_point = "visit_date"
)

# Example 2: Measurement delay - exposure measured at next visit
tme_delay <- new_temporal_measurement_error(
  error_type = "delayed",
  affected_variables = c("t1_a", "t2_a"),
  delay = 1,  # measured 1 wave later
  carry_forward = TRUE  # exposure value persists
)

# Example 3: Anticipatory measurement
tme_anticip <- new_temporal_measurement_error(
  error_type = "anticipatory",
  affected_variables = "t2_a",
  lead_time = 7,  # recorded 7 days before actual start
  probability = 0.8  # 80\% follow through with planned exposure
)
